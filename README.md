# Air-pollution-detector
As we all are very much aware about the crisis of air pollution that goes on increasing day by day and its harmful effects.

Many times, we see reports about pollution in different media. Recently the pollution levels in Delhi were a point of major concern affecting all of us.

Many times, the organisations causing pollution such as industries are not following the proper rules of the pollution control board and they don't even get immediately reported to the authorities which results in lack of  action. By the time of inspection, the pollution has occurred but is hidden from the authorities.

To prevent such cases I have made an air pollution detector to detect the pollution and report it to both the authorities and their concerned incharge of that particular area so that quick and strict action could be taken resulting in good air quality and also improve our health .
